            <h2>Hi, I'm Jack</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My full name is John Donovan Denney III. I care about the Earth, People and Technology. I am extremely passionate about technology. I have buit two computers and have even watercooled my second one. I know computer hardware inside and out.
                I know how to use and fix a computer and their problems inside and out. I really enjoy computers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I belive in doing the right thing. Even if its tough I think that its important to do whats right to you and others. As I said I enjoy computers but I also really like in my spare time wating Youtube and Netflix. I spend a lot of my time on
                YouTube but Netflix is also good but, its harder to stop watching Netflix in comparison to YouTube. If I could create a class from scratch I would make it about computers and how to build them and get them set up with sofware etc.</p>
            <!-- Took abt stuff from past project -->

            <p>My skills have improved alot over the years. Let me know what you think of my website and please enjoy your stay!</p>
