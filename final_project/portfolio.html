            <h3>Here is my portfolio,</h3>
            <p>This is a small accumilation of some of my projects that I have done. You will find everything from major assignments to homework to class work and even a bit of my own endeavours. There is a varying amount of skill between each website but
                it does give a overall picture of what I am comfortable with. Try not to judge too much :)</p>
